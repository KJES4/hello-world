        <h2 class="card-title">Where It All Began</h2>
        <p>I moved to China with my husband in November of 2017. When I first got there I was amazed at how modern and lit up the city was. It was nothing like the China I had imagined. While I was there I began teaching English to local school children. And within two years I had gained enough experience and enough of a following that I was able to open my own English training facility. Through being a business owner, I learned how to persevere and not give up in order to achieve success. I also learned that in order to achieve a long-term goal you must have dynamic short-term goals that allow you to adapt to the ever-changing environment. This was a big change for me. I had always been someone who made lists, plans, and goals but I stubbornly stuck with them or gave up. My plans had to work out exactly as I had hoped to the T or else I would lose faith in their fruition. Being in this new position in life forced me to be more adaptive in my short-term goals so that I could eventually achieve my end game.
        </P>
        <p>The school was an instant hit and parents loved the school's active based learning teaching style. Using my natural gifts of observation I was able to tune into the need and wants of both parents and students. I worked and studied hard to make sure my students could learn in a way that was most natural for them. I made sure everyone received testing to see what English they already knew, what they didn't know, and what they were aware of but didn't know how to use properly. Then based off of the combined knowledge and needs of the class I would create lessons that would review prior knowledge while at the same time learning new material. I made sure that students practiced memorization, correct usage, and memory recall in a context that related to and excited them. I was able to develop such an effective teaching method that some of my students went on to compete in a national contest for English.
        </p>
        <p>I may have been having a lot of personal success with work but personally, my life was not fulfilling. I missed my family and lifestyle back home. I also grew tired of the mundane teaching routine that I had spent so much time to thoroughly research and develop. After months of purposeful introspection, I decided to move back to the United States. I decided to go into the field of design since this would allow me to do research testing and analysis that I loved. I would constantly get to work on different tasks and be able to solve lots of problems.
        </p>
        <p>And that is what I have been doing over the course of the past two years. I really enjoy online web design and marketing because it allows me to work on a vast number of different businesses, and I get to find ways to help companies that deserve to be noticed get attention. I hope to increase my skills in marketing and web design so that I can attract people to worthy businesses such as health, technology, education, and so on. I look forward to helping these business owners connect with their audiences, find their voice, and get the respect they deserve.
