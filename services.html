          <p id="one">A brand is more than a logo. A brand is every interaction you have with your customers, a brand is the expectations people have when they think of your service or product, it’s the feelings your customers associate with you and the relationships you have with them. Brand identity determines the perceived value of your products and services by your customers and that dictates the price people are willing to pay for them. All of these factors need to be considered when designing your unique brand identity.</p>

          <h2 class="services-title">Web Design and Development</h2>
          <img class="image_skill web" src="images/web.jpg" alt="picture of different brand logos grouped by color forming a circle">
          <p id="two"> A successful website must represent the company’s goals and mission within every element of its design. This includes but is not limited to color schemes, typography, and images. All of these need to be chosen in accordance with your unique brand identity. It is necessary when designing the functionality of your site to consider what goals your potential customers may have when they visit your site and what actions you want them to take to begin forming a relationship with you.</p>

          <img class="image_skill social" src="images/imageedit_1_8926726233.png" alt="picture of different brand logos grouped by color forming a circle">
          <p id="three">With more attention than ever being directed to online and social media sites it is vital that your business has an effective online marketing strategy. To have success with online marketing, your unique brand message needs to be consistent across all of your content. You need to be aware of who your ideal customer audiences are, how to find them, and what appeals most to them.</P>
